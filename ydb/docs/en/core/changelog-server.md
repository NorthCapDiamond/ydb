## Version 24.1 {#24-1}

Release date: July 31, 2024.

### Functionality

* The [Knn UDF](./yql/reference/udf/list/knn.md) function for precise nearest vector search has been implemented.
* The gRPC Query service has been developed, enabling the execution of all types of queries (DML, DDL) and retrieval of unlimited amounts of data.
* [Integration with the LDAP protocol](./concepts/auth.md) has been implemented, allowing the retrieval of a list of groups from external LDAP directories.

### Embedded UI

* The database information tab now includes a resource consumption diagnostic dashboard, which allows users to assess the current consumption of key resources: processor cores, RAM, and distributed storage space.
* Charts for monitoring the key performance indicators of the {{ ydb-short-name }} cluster have been added.

### Performance

* [Session timeouts](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/1837) for the coordination service between server and client have been optimized. Previously, the timeout was 5 seconds, which could result in a 10-second delay in identifying an unresponsive client and releasing its resources. In the new version, the check interval depends on the session's wait time, allowing for faster responses during leader changes or when acquiring distributed locks.
* CPU consumption by [SchemeShard](./concepts/glossary.md#scheme-shard) replicas has been [optimized](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/2391), particularly when handling rapid updates for tables with a large number of partitions.

### Bug fixes

* A possible queue overflow error has been [fixed](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/3917). [Change Data Capture](./dev/cdc.md) now reserves the change queue capacity during the initial scan.
* A potential deadlock between receiving and sending CDC records has been [fixed](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/4597).
* An issue causing the loss of the mediator task queue during mediator reconnection has been [fixed](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/2056). This fix allows processing of the mediator task queue during resynchronization.
* A rarely occurring error has been [fixed](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/2624), where with volatile transactions enabled, a successful transaction confirmation result could be returned before the transaction was fully committed. Volatile transactions remain disabled by default and are still under development.
* A rare error that led to the loss of established locks and the successful confirmation of transactions that should have failed with a "Transaction Locks Invalidated" error has been [fixed](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/2839).
* A rare error that could result in a violation of data integrity guarantees during concurrent read and write operations on a specific key has been [fixed](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/3074).
* An issue causing read replicas to stop processing requests has been [fixed](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/4343).
* A rare error that could cause abnormal termination of database processes if there were uncommitted transactions on a table during its renaming has been [fixed](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/4979).
* An error in determining the status of a static group, where it was not marked as non-working when it should have been, has been [fixed](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/3632).
* An error involving partial commits of a distributed transaction with uncommitted changes, caused by certain race conditions with restarts, has been [fixed](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/2169).
* Anomalies related to reading outdated data, [detected using Jepsen](https://blog.ydb.tech/hardening-ydb-with-jepsen-lessons-learned-e3238a7ef4f2), have been [fixed](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/2374).

## Version 23.4 {#23-4}

Release date: May 14, 2024.

### Performance

* [Fixed](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/3638) an issue of increased CPU consumption by a topic actor `PERSQUEUE_PARTITION_ACTOR`.
* [Optimized](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/2083) resource usage by SchemeBoard replicas. The greatest effect is noticeable when modifying the metadata of tables with a large number of partitions.

### Bug fixes

* [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/2169) of possible partial commit of accumulated changes when using persistent distributed transactions. This error occurs in an extremely rare combination of events, including restarting tablets that service the table partitions involved in the transaction.
* [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/3165) involving a race condition between the table merge and garbage collection processes, which could result in garbage collection ending with an invariant violation error, leading to an abnormal termination of the `ydbd` server process.
* [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/2696) in Blob Storage, where information about changes to the composition of a storage group might not be received in a timely manner by individual cluster nodes. As a result, reads and writes of data stored in the affected group could become blocked in rare cases, requiring manual intervention.
* [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/3002) in Blob Storage, where data storage nodes might not start despite the correct configuration. The error occurred on systems with the experimental "blob depot" feature explicitly enabled (this feature is disabled by default).
* [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/2475) that sometimes occurred when writing to a topic with an empty `producer_id` with turned off deduplication. It could lead to abnormal termination of the `ydbd` server process.
* [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/2651) that caused the `ydbd` process to crash due to an incorrect session state when writing to a topic.
* [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/3587) in displaying the metric of number of partitions in a topic, where it previously displayed an incorrect value.
* [Fixed a bug](https://github.com/ydb-platform/ydb/pull/2126) causing memory leaks that appeared when copying topic data between clusters. These could cause `ydbd` server processes to terminate due to out-of-memory issues.

## Version 23.3 {#23-3}

Release date: October 12, 2023.

### Functionality

* Implemented visibility of own changes. With this feature enabled you can read changed values from the current transaction, which has not been committed yet. This functionality also allows multiple modifying operations in one transaction on a table with secondary indexes.
* Added support for [column tables](concepts/datamodel/table.md#column-tables). It is now possible to create analytical reports based on stored data in YDB with performance comparable to specialized analytical DBMS.
* Added support for Kafka API for topics. YDB topics can now be accessed via a Kafka-compatible API designed for migrating existing applications. Support for Kafka protocol version 3.4.0 is provided.
* Added the ability to [write to a topic without deduplication](concepts/topic.md#no-dedup). This is important in cases where message processing order is not critical.
* YQL has added the capabilities to [create](yql/reference/syntax/create-topic.md), [modify](yql/reference/syntax/alter-topic.md), and [delete](yql/reference/syntax/delete.md) topics.
* Added support of assigning and revoking access rights using the YQL `GRANT` and `REVOKE` commands.
* Added support of DML-operations logging in the audit log.
* **_(Experimental)_** When writing messages to a topic, it is now possible to pass metadata. To enable this functionality, add `enable_topic_message_meta: true` to the [configuration file](reference/configuration/index.md).
* **_(Experimental)_** Added support for [reading from topics in a transaction](reference/ydb-sdk/topic.md#read-tx). It is now possible to read from topics and write to tables within a transaction, simplifying the data transfer scenario from a topic to a table. To enable this functionality, add `enable_topic_service_tx: true` to the [configuration file](reference/configuration/index.md).
* **_(Experimental)_** Added support for PostgreSQL compatibility. This involves executing SQL queries in PostgreSQL dialect on the YDB infrastructure using the PostgreSQL network protocol. With this capability, familiar PostgreSQL tools such as psql and drivers (e.g., pq for Golang and psycopg2 for Python) can be used. Queries can be developed using the familiar PostgreSQL syntax and take advantage of YDB's benefits such as horizontal scalability and fault tolerance.
* **_(Experimental)_** Added support for federated queries. This enables retrieving information from various data sources without the need to move the data into YDB. Federated queries support interaction with ClickHouse and PostgreSQL databases, as well as S3 class data stores (Object Storage). YQL queries can be used to access these databases without duplicating data between systems.

### Embedded UI

* A new option `PostgreSQL` has been added to the query type selector settings, which is available when the `Enable additional query modes` parameter is enabled. Also, the query history now takes into account the syntax used when executing the query.
* The YQL query template for creating a table has been updated. Added a description of the available parameters.
* Now sorting and filtering for Storage and Nodes tables takes place on the server. To use this functionality, you need to enable the parameter `Offload tables filters and sorting to backend` in the experiments section.
* Buttons for creating, changing and deleting [topics](concepts/topic.md) have been added to the context menu.
* Added sorting by criticality for all issues in the tree in `Healthcheck`.

### Performance

* Implemented read iterators. This feature allows to separate reads and computations. Read iterators allow datashards to increase read queries throughput.
* The performance of writing to YDB topics has been optimized.
* Improved tablet balancing during node overload.

## Version 23.2 {#23-2}

Release date: August 14, 2023.

### Functionality

* **_(Experimental)_** Implemented visibility of own changes. With this feature enabled you can read changed values from the current transaction, which has not been committed yet. This functionality also allows multiple modifying operations in one transaction on a table with secondary indexes. To enable this feature add `enable_kqp_immediate_effects: true` under `table_service_config` section into [configuration file](reference/configuration/index.md).
* **_(Experimental)_** Implemented read iterators. This feature allows to separate reads and computations. Read iterators allow datashards to increase read queries throughput. To enable this feature add `enable_kqp_data_query_source_read: true` under `table_service_config` section into [configuration file](reference/configuration/index.md).

### Embedded UI

* Navigation improvements:
  * Diagnostics and Development mode switches are moved to the left panel.
  * Every page has breadcrumbs.
  * Storage groups and nodes info are moved from left buttons to tabs on the database page.
* Query history and saved queries are moved to tabs over the text editor area in query editor.
* Info tab for scheme objects displays parameters using terms from `CREATE` or `ALTER` statements.
* Added [column tables](concepts/datamodel/table.md#column-tables) support.

### Performance

* For scan queries, you can now effectively search for individual rows using a primary key or secondary indexes. This can bring you a substantial performance gain in many cases. Similarly to regular queries, you need to explicitly specify its name in the query text using the `VIEW` keyword to use a secondary index.

* **_(Experimental)_** Added an option to give control of the system tablets of the database (SchemeShard, Coordinators, Mediators, SysViewProcessor) to its own Hive instead of the root Hive, and do so immediately upon creating a new database. Without this flag, the system tablets of the new database are created in the root Hive, which can negatively impact its load. Enabling this flag makes databases completely isolated in terms of load, that may be particularly relevant for installations, consisting from a roughly hundred or more databases. To enable this feature add `alter_database_create_hive_first: true` under `feature_flags` section into [configuration file](reference/configuration/index.md).

### Bug fixes

* Fixed a bug in the autoconfiguration of the actor system, resulting in all the load being placed on the system pool.
* Fixed a bug that caused full scanning when searching by prefix of the primary key using `LIKE`.
* Fixed bugs when interacting with datashard followers.
* Fixed bugs when working with memory in column tables.
* Fixed a bug in processing conditions for immediate transactions.
* Fixed a bug in the operation of iterator-based reads on datasharrd followers.
* Fixed a bug that caused cascading reinstallation of data delivery sessions to asynchronous indexes.
* Fixed bugs in the optimizer for scanning queries.
* Fixed a bug in the incorrect calculation of storage consumption by Hive after expanding the database.
* Fixed a bug that caused operations to hang on non-existent iterators.
* Fixed bugs when reading a range on a `NOT NULL` column.
* Fixed a bug in the replication of VDisks.
* Fixed a bug in the work of the `run_interval` option in TTL.

## Version 23.1 {#23-1}

Release date: May 5, 2023. To update to version 23.1, select the [Downloads](downloads/index.md#ydb-server) section.

### Functionality

* Added [initial table scan](concepts/cdc.md#initial-scan) when creating a CDC changefeed. Now, you can export all the data existing at the time of changefeed creation.
* Added [atomic index replacement](dev/secondary-indexes.md#atomic-index-replacement). Now, you can atomically replace one pre-defined index with another. This operation is absolutely transparent for your application. Indexes are replaced seamlessly, with no downtime.
* Added the [audit log](security/audit-log.md): Event stream including data about all the operations on {{ ydb-short-name }} objects.

### Performance

* Improved formats of data exchanged between query stages. As a result, we accelerated SELECTs by 10% on parameterized queries and by up to 30% on write operations.
* Added [autoconfiguring](reference/configuration/index.md#autoconfig) for the actor system pools based on the workload against them. This improves performance through more effective CPU sharing.
* Optimized the predicate logic: Processing of parameterized OR or IN constraints is automatically delegated to DataShard.
* (Experimental) For scan queries, you can now effectively search for individual rows using a primary key or secondary indexes. This can bring you a substantial gain in performance in many cases. Similarly to regular queries, to use a secondary index, you need to explicitly specify its name in the query text using the `VIEW` keyword.
* The query's computational graph is now cached at query runtime, reducing the CPU resources needed to build the graph.

### Bug fixes

* Fixed bugs in the distributed data warehouse implementation. We strongly recommend all our users to upgrade to the latest version.
* Fixed the error that occurred on building an index on NOT NULL columns.
* Fixed statistics calculation with MVCC enabled.
* Fixed errors with backups.
* Fixed the race condition that occurred at splitting and deleting a table with SDC.

## Version 22.5 {#22-5}

* You can now [rename tables](concepts/datamodel/table.md#rename) that have TTL enabled.
* You can now [manage the record retention period](concepts/cdc.md#retention-period).

### Bug fixes and improvements

* Fixed an error inserting 0 rows with a BulkUpsert.
* Fixed an error importing Date/DateTime columns from CSV.
* Fixed an error importing CSV data with line breaks.
* Fixed an error importing CSV data with NULL values.
* Improved Query Processing performance (by replacing WorkerActor with SessionActor).
* DataShard compaction now starts immediately after a split or merge.
